## Usage

1. **Review the Scripts**: It's crucial to review the scripts and understand the configurations before executing them. Open the script files in a text editor and familiarize yourself with each step and its purpose.

2. **Run as Administrator**: For Windows scripts, ensure that you run them with administrative privileges. Right-click on the script file and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu.

3. **Confirmation Prompts**: As the scripts progress, they will display explanations of each step and prompt for confirmation before applying the configurations. Take the time to review each step and ensure it aligns with your organization's requirements.

4. **Modify as Needed**: The scripts provide general configurations, but you may need to modify certain settings to fit your organization's specific needs. Adjust the scripts accordingly, ensuring the changes align with your security policies and compliance requirements.

5. **Test in a Controlled Environment**: Before applying the scripts to production systems, it's highly recommended to test the configurations in a controlled environment. This allows you to evaluate their impact and ensure compatibility with your existing infrastructure.

**IMPORTANT**: Change the credentials for the administrator account (AdminAccount) in the Windows scripts by modifying the scripts before running them.
