# Cyber Essentials Plus Overview

This document provides an overview of the Cyber Essentials Plus standards and outlines the key requirements for achieving compliance. Cyber Essentials Plus is a cybersecurity certification scheme developed by the UK Government to help organizations protect against common cyber threats.

## What is Cyber Essentials Plus?

Cyber Essentials Plus is an extension of the Cyber Essentials certification, focusing on more advanced security controls and additional testing. It provides a higher level of assurance by subjecting the organization's systems to independent vulnerability testing and verification.

## Key Requirements for Cyber Essentials Plus Compliance

1. **Boundary Firewalls and Internet Gateways**: Ensure that your organization has a secure boundary firewall and internet gateway to protect your network from unauthorized access.

2. **Secure Configuration**: Implement secure configurations for all devices used within your organization. This includes desktops, laptops, servers, and other network devices.

3. **Access Control**: Control access to your systems and data by enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, including passwords, two-factor authentication, or biometric authentication.

4. **Malware Protection**: Install and maintain up-to-date antivirus and antimalware software on all devices to protect against known threats.

5. **Patch Management**: Regularly apply security patches and updates to all software and firmware used within your organization to address known vulnerabilities.

6. **Secure Network Configuration**: Configure your network securely, ensuring that default settings are changed, unnecessary services are disabled, and access controls are implemented.

7. **User Education and Awareness**: Educate your staff about cybersecurity best practices and provide regular training to help them identify and respond to common threats.

## How to Achieve Cyber Essentials Plus Compliance

To achieve Cyber Essentials Plus compliance, organizations need to undergo a series of steps:

1. **Self-Assessment**: Conduct a self-assessment using the Cyber Essentials Plus questionnaire to evaluate your organization's security practices.

2. **External Vulnerability Testing**: Engage an external certifying body or an approved independent tester to perform vulnerability testing and verification of your systems.

3. **Remediation**: Address any identified vulnerabilities and implement the necessary security controls to meet the Cyber Essentials Plus requirements.

4. **Verification**: The external certifying body or independent tester will verify that your systems meet the Cyber Essentials Plus standards through further testing and evaluation.

5. **Certification**: Once the verification process is successfully completed, you will receive the Cyber Essentials Plus certification, demonstrating your organization's commitment to cybersecurity best practices.
