4. **Enable User Account Control (UAC)**: Enable UAC to prompt for consent or credentials before allowing changes that require administrative privileges.

5. **Disable Autorun/Autoplay**: Disable Autorun and Autoplay features for removable devices to reduce the risk of executing malicious code.

6. **Enable BitLocker Drive Encryption**: Enable BitLocker drive encryption to protect sensitive data in case of theft or loss.

7. **Configure Password Complexity**: Set up a strong password policy to ensure that user accounts have secure passwords.

8. **Disable Unused Services**: Disable unnecessary services to minimize potential attack vectors.

9. **Configure Auditing**: Configure auditing settings to monitor system events and detect suspicious activity.

10. **Disable SMBv1 Protocol**: Disable the outdated SMBv1 protocol to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

11. **Disable Unnecessary Network Protocols**: Disable unnecessary network protocols to reduce the attack surface.

12. **Enable Windows Defender Antivirus**: Enable Windows Defender Antivirus to provide real-time protection against malware.

13. **Enable Windows Defender SmartScreen**: Enable Windows Defender SmartScreen to protect against malicious websites and downloads.

14. **Enable Windows Firewall Logging**: Enable Windows Firewall logging to monitor network traffic and identify potential threats.

15. **Disable Unused and Insecure Protocols**: Disable unused and insecure protocols to mitigate security risks.

16. **Configure Strong Cipher Suites**: Configure strong cipher suites to ensure secure communication channels.

17. **Disable Unnecessary Browser Plugins**: Disable unnecessary browser plugins to reduce the risk of exploitation.

18. **Disable Autorun for Removable Devices**: Disable Autorun for removable devices to prevent automatic execution of malicious code.

19. **Enable Full Disk Encryption (BitLocker)**: Enable full disk encryption (BitLocker) if supported by your hardware to protect data at rest.

20. **Configure Windows Event Logging**: Configure Windows Event Logging to capture and analyze security-related events.

21. **Configure Account Lockout Policy**: Configure account lockout policy to prevent brute-force attacks.

22. **Enable Strong Password Policy**: Enable a strong password policy to enforce secure password requirements.

23. **Enable Windows Defender Firewall Domain Profile**: Enable the Windows Defender Firewall domain profile to protect against network-based attacks.

24. **Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP**: Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP to minimize the risk of NetBIOS-related attacks.

25. **Enable Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) Features**: Enable EMET features if installed to enhance application security.

26. **Configure Windows Update**: Configure Windows Update to ensure that security patches and updates are applied in a timely manner.

27. **Enable AppLocker**: Enable AppLocker to control which applications can run on your system.

28. **Disable Guest Accounts**: Disable guest accounts to minimize unauthorized access.
